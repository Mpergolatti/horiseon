# Horiseon - Seach Engine Management

## Description

I took an already working HTML / CSS site and implemented changes in regards to what the client specified. Changes we made are as followed:

* Optimized semantic tags in HTML for readability.

* Added quality comments to the index.html file to make finding specific sections easier.

* Consolidated Class attributes in both index.html and style.css to help keep code clean while still being effective.

* Moved around some CSS elements to follow the structure in the index.html file so its easier to read.

* Ensured all links were working properly

* Renamed the title to show a page name and minor description

* Changed benefits section "p" element to center text for better readability

* Added alt tags and aria-label tags to ensure accessibility was readable
